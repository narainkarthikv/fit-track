# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the latest release on the default branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security reports.

- Preferred: report via GitHub Security Advisories.
  https://github.com/narainkarthikv/fit-track/security/advisories/new
- If you cannot use GitHub advisories, open a minimal GitHub issue and request a private follow-up.

We will acknowledge valid reports and work on a fix as soon as possible.
